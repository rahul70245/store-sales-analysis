# store-sales-analysis
Technology used in this analysis project is excel.
For doing this project I have taken raw data from a cloth store. It has 18 columns and approximately 31000 rows and the data is of 2022 year. In this first thing I did was to clean the data properly
as it was raw unclean data and had many duplicacy issues. I have made 5 KPI's in the dashboard like how much sales is done in the full year, total orders in different bussiness channels, returned percentage,
etc. I had done analysis through visualization also for example pie chart for how much sales is done through different sales channels, top states in which sales are maximum with bar chart, how much orders are
met by combining chart i.e. orders vs sales and many more.
